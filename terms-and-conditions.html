  <div class="container">
    <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      Tribal is designed to digitally preserve tribal culture, rituals, languages, traditional songs, and heritage.
      The platform aims to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Share authentic community knowledge across generations</li>
      <li>Provide educational and cultural insights to a broader audience</li>
      <li>Support the recognition and upliftment of tribal identity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All features of the App are intended to respect and celebrate indigenous traditions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The Tribal app is open to all users—regardless of caste, religion, or background—who wish to engage respectfully
      with tribal knowledge. Users may be asked tribal-related questions during login to promote awareness, not to
      restrict access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harmful, disrespectful, or inappropriate behavior may result in restricted or terminated access without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Content Collection and Cultural Data</h2>
    <p>
      Content is derived from oral traditions passed down through generations in Adivasi communities, including songs,
      stories, and rituals. All content is collected with cultural respect and is used solely for educational and
      preservation purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Content Usage</h2>
    <p>
      All content is curated by the Tribal team or verified contributors. Users cannot directly upload or publish content.
      Each item is credited appropriately. Sensitive topics are shared to promote understanding, not to cause harm.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Reproduction and Publishing Policy</h2>
    <p>
      No content may be reproduced or distributed externally without written permission. Requests should be emailed to:

    <h2>6. Community Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      Users cannot publicly post content. Suggestions can be made via the Suggestions section. Inappropriate suggestions
      may lead to account suspension.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Privacy and Data</h2>
    <p>
      Tribal respects your privacy. We collect only necessary basic information during onboarding and do not sell or
      share your data. Data is securely stored.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All content—including articles, images, and media—is the intellectual property of the Tribal team or licensed
      authors. Reuse requires written consent.

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
